# squadra — project instructions

squadra is the packaged, reusable extraction of the AFK vertical-slice fleet
(deterministic supervisor + per-slice runner machinery) originally built in the
`gswa` backend under ADR-0007. It drives an unattended, board-driven Claude
implementation fleet against a **target repository** identified by `FLEET_HOME`.

See `README.md` for how the fleet works and how to run it.

## Stack

- Python ≥ 3.11, **pure standard library** at runtime (no third-party deps).
- Build: **uv + Hatchling**, PEP 621 `[project]`, **src layout** (`src/squadra/`).
- Tooling: **ruff** (lint) + **pyright (strict)** + **pytest**, all via `uv run`.
- Console scripts: `squadra` — the unified argparse CLI
  (`init`/`tick`/`start`/`stop`/`status`/`log` + `squadra slice
  {init|update|heartbeat|show}`); `squadra-status` is kept as a **deprecated
  alias** until the coupled gswa PR lands. `python -m squadra.supervisor` and
  `python -m squadra.status` remain as internal module entry points.

```

## Hard invariants

- **Packaged-script resolution.** Anything that invokes the shell glue (the
  supervisor's `SandboxAccess` launch, the `squadra` CLI's ticker subcommands,
  the tick entry point) MUST resolve it via `squadra._resources.resolve_script(...)`
  (`importlib.resources.files("squadra")/"_scripts"`, `chmod +x` on resolve) —
  **never** a path relative to `FLEET_HOME`. The package is not the working repo.
- **`FLEET_HOME`** = the repo the fleet operates on (default: cwd). No hardcoded
  default path.
- **`FLEET_PYTHON`** = an interpreter that has squadra installed. The supervisor
  injects its own `sys.executable` into runner panes; shells default to `python3`.
- **Strong typing everywhere** — every file must pass `pyright` (strict) with 0
  errors. Modern syntax: `X | None`, `list[X]`, `-> None` always explicit.
- **No silent permission/behavior broadening** in the fleet's claim/reap/finalize
  logic — it is security-sensitive board automation.

## Validation (before hand-off)

```bash
uv run ruff check .            # 0 errors
uv run ruff format --check .   # no reformats pending
uv run pyright                 # strict, 0 errors
uv run pytest                  # unit + hermetic shell tests
```

The hermetic shell test (`tests/scripts/run-runner-wrap-tests.sh`) needs `bash`;
it runs against a stubbed `claude` and a temp fleet root (no network/ADO/tmux).

## Git & PR conventions

- Type-prefixed commit subjects (`feat:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `fix:`,
  `docs:`, `ci:` …); each commit a coherent, self-contained unit (no WIP).
- Authenticate from inside the container via `gh auth login` (device flow),
  which wires git's credential helper for HTTPS push (this container has no SSH
  key) and enables `gh pr`. Commit with `commit.gpgsign=false`.
- **No Claude/Anthropic authorship trailers** on commits, PR bodies, or tags.
- On GitHub everything (PR descriptions, issues) renders **Markdown**.
- `main` is protected by a branch ruleset — require a PR + the GitHub Actions
  CI check + branches up to date; merge via **merge commit**. GitHub has no
  native semi-linear merge, so keep linear history **by convention**: rebase
  your branch onto `main` before merge (preserves `git revert -m 1 <merge>`
  per-PR atomic revert and `git log --first-parent` PR-level history). This is
  a delta from ADO, where semi-linear was gate-enforced.
