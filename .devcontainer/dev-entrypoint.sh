# --- Berth: mount-target ownership repair (ADR-0013) -----------------------------------
# A named volume mounted at a path the image did not pre-create dev-owned lands
# root:root, and the tool whose state it persists cannot write it. The image is the wrong
# place to guarantee ownership — the entrypoint is the one component present when the
# mount happens, whoever wrote the Dockerfile — so the ownership is repaired here, at the
# one moment both the volume and the login user are present. Policy, per target: a
# directory owned by uid 0 and EMPTY is re-owned to the login user (0700); everything else
# is reported and left alone, mode included. Never recursive, never `chown -R`, never
# fatal: sshd is the operator's way in to fix whatever this could not, so starting it
# always comes first.

# Print the Docker named-volume mount targets under $HOME, one per line, read from a
# mountinfo(5) file. Field 4 is the mount root — a named volume's is
# `<docker-root>/volumes/<name>/_data` — and field 5 the mountpoint; the kernel escapes
# space, tab, newline and backslash in both as \040, \011, \012 and \134. Bind mounts (the
# workspace checkout, the authorized_keys file) fail the root test and are skipped.
