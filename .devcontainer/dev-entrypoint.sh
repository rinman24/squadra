# Bring up the in-container sshd, publish the container's environment where sshd login
# shells can see it, then hand off to the CMD (`sleep infinity`). The venv bootstrap
# (`uv sync --frozen`) stays in devcontainer.json's postCreateCommand, which billet runs
# after a cold `billet start` (and VS Code runs on attach). A bare `docker compose up` /
# scripts/devbox/up.sh runs the sync itself.
#
# sshd must run as root (privilege separation + per-session setuid to `dev`), but the
# container's default user is the non-root `dev` (uid 1000) so login sessions and
# `docker exec` land as dev. So we keep `dev` as default and launch the system sshd via
# the passwordless sudo the image grants.

# --- Berth: mount-target ownership repair (ADR-0013) -----------------------------------
# A named volume mounted at a path the image did not pre-create dev-owned lands
# root:root, and the tool whose state it persists cannot write it. The image is the wrong
# place to guarantee ownership — a Workspace on a shared base image does not author its
# Dockerfile — so the ownership is repaired here, at the one moment both the volume and
# the login user are present. Policy, per target: a directory owned by uid 0 and EMPTY is
# re-owned to the login user (0700); everything else is reported and left alone, mode
# included. Never recursive, never `chown -R`, never fatal: sshd is the operator's way in
# to fix whatever this could not, so starting it always comes first.

# Print the Docker named-volume mount targets under $HOME, one per line, read from a
# mountinfo(5) file. Field 4 is the mount root — a named volume's is
# `<docker-root>/volumes/<name>/_data` — and field 5 the mountpoint; the kernel escapes
# space, tab, newline and backslash in both as \040, \011, \012 and \134. Bind mounts (the
# workspace checkout, the authorized_keys file) fail the root test and are skipped.
