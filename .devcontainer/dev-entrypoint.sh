# squadra dev-container entrypoint — from billet's templates/workspace/dev-entrypoint.sh.
# Bring up the in-container sshd, publish the container's environment where sshd login
# shells can see it, then hand off to the CMD (`sleep infinity`). The venv bootstrap
# (`uv sync --frozen`) stays in devcontainer.json's postCreateCommand, which billet runs
# after a cold `billet start` (and VS Code runs on attach). A bare `docker compose up` /
# scripts/devbox/up.sh runs the sync itself.
#
# sshd must run as root (privilege separation + per-session setuid to `dev`), but the
# container's default user is the non-root `dev` (uid 1000) so login sessions and
# `docker exec` land as dev. So we keep `dev` as default and launch the system sshd via
# the passwordless sudo the image grants.
