# Bring up the in-container sshd, then hand off to the CMD (`sleep infinity`). The venv
# bootstrap (`uv sync --frozen`) stays in devcontainer.json's postCreateCommand, which
# billet runs after a cold `billet start` (and VS Code runs on attach). A bare
# `docker compose up` / scripts/devbox/up.sh runs the sync itself.
#
# sshd must run as root (privilege separation + per-session setuid to `dev`), but the
# container's default user is the non-root `dev` (uid 1000) so login sessions and
# `docker exec` land as dev. So we keep `dev` as default and launch the system sshd via
# the passwordless sudo the image grants.
